## Copying Project to Debian VM

To copy your project to a Debian VM for testing and demo purposes, you can use the `scp` command. Replace the placeholders with your specific values:

1. **Copy Your Project to the Debian VM**:

   
   scp -r /path/to/your/cloud username@your-debian-vm-ip:/path/to/destination/
   ```

   Replace:
   - `/path/to/your/cloud` with the local path to your project folder
   - `username` with your SSH username for the Debian VM
   - `your-debian-vm-ip` with the IP address or hostname of your Debian VM
   - `/path/to/destination/` with the path on the VM where you want to copy your project files


2. **SSH into the Debian VM**:

   ```bash
   ssh username@your-debian-vm-ip
   ```

   Replace `username` with your SSH username and `your-debian-vm-ip` with the IP address or hostname of your Debian VM.

3. **Navigate to the Destination Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/destination/
   ```

   Change to the directory where you copied your project.

4. **Install Dependencies and Start the Application**:
  sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install unzip
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
